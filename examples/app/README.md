# app

A cross-platform todo app using drift for local persistence.

## Supported platforms

This app runs on

- Android
- iOS
- macOS
- Linux
- Windows
- Web

When running the app, either with `flutter run` or by running the outputs of
`flutter build`, native sqlite3 dependencies should be set up automatically.
When running the app in a regular Dart VM, for instance through `flutter test`,
you need to ensure that sqlite3 is available yourself. See the [documentation](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/docs/platforms/#desktop)
for more details on this.

## Development

As this app uses drift, it depends on code-generation.
Use `flutter pub run build_runner build` to automatically build the generated
code.

### Testing

Drift databases don't depend on platform-channels or Flutter-specific features
by default. This means that they can easily be used in unit tests.
One such test is in `test/database_test.dart`

#### Testing migrations

After changing the structure of your database schema, for instance by adding
new tables or altering columns, you need to write a migration to ensure that
existing users of your app can convert their database to the latest version.

Drift contains [builtin APIs](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/docs/advanced-features/migrations/)
for common migrations.
Also, it includes builtin tools to verify that migrations are doing what they're
supposed to do.

To write such tests, run the following command after making schema changes and
incrementing your schema version. It will export the current schema of the
database as a JSON file. You should check those generated files into source control.

```
flutter pub run drift_dev schema dump lib/database/database.dart drift_schemas/
```

Then, run the following command to automatically generate test utilities which
you can use to write unit tests for schema migrations:

```
flutter pub run drift_dev schema generate drift_schemas/ test/generated_migrations/
```

An example for a schema test is in `test/migration_test.dart`.
